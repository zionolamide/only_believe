            <h3>118. The Great Judgement.</h3>
               <p>I dreamed that the great judgment</p>
               <p>morning Had dawned, and the</p>
               <P>trumpet had blown; I dreamed that</P>
               <P>the nations had gathered To judgment</P>
               <p>before the white throne; From the</p>
               <p>throne came a bright shining angel,</p>
               <p>And stood on the land and the sea,</p>
               <p>And swore with his hand raised to</p>
               <p>heaven, That time was no longer to</p>
               <p>be.</p>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <h3 class="chorus">Chorus</h3>
                   <p>And O, what a weeping and</p>
                   <p>wailing,</p>
                   <p>As the lost were told of their fate;</p>
                   <p>They cried for the rocks and the</p>
                   <p>mountains,</p>
                   <p>They prayed, but their prayers were</p>
                   <p>too late.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>The rich man was there, but his money</p>
                <p>Had melted and vanished away; A</p>
                <p>pauper he stood in the judgment, His</p>
                <p>debts were too heavy to pay; The great</p>
                <p>man was there, but his greatness,</p>
                <p>When death came, was left far behind.</p>
                <p>The angel that opened the records,</p>
                <p>Not a trace of his greatness could find.</p>
            </div> 
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>The widow was there with the</p>
                <p>orphans, God heard and remembered</p>
                <p>their cries; No sorrow in heaven</p>
                <p>forever. God wiped all the tears from</p>
                <p>their eyes; The gambler was there and</p>
                <p>the drunkard, And the man that had</p>
                <p>sold them the drink, With the people</p>
                <p>who gave him the license, Together in</p>
                <p>hell they did sink.</p>
            </div> 
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>The moral man came to the judgment,</p>
                <p>But his self-righteous rags would not</p>
                <p>do; The men who had crucified Jesus</p>
                <p>Had passed off as moral men, too;</p>
                <p>The soul that had put off salvation,</p>
                <p>“Not tonight; I’ll get saved by and by,</p>
                <p>No time now to think of religion!” At</p>
                <p>last they had found time to die.</p>
