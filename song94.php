            <h3>94. The Meeting In The Air.</h3>            
               <p>You have heard of little Moses in the</p>
               <p>bulrush, You have heard of fearless</p>
               <p>David and his sling; You have heard</p>
               <p>the story told of dreaming Joseph,</p>
               <p>And of Jonah and the whale you often</p>
               <p>sing. There are many, many others</p>
               <p>through the Bible. I should like to</p>
               <p>meet them all, I do declare! By and by</p>
               <p>the Lord will surely let us meet them</p>
               <p>At the meeting in the air.</p>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <h3 class="chorus">Chorus</h3>
                  <p>There is going to be a meeting in</p>
                  <p>the air,</p>
                  <p>In the sweet, sweet by and by;</p>
                  <p>I am going to meet you, meet you</p>
                  <p>there</p>
                  <p>In that home beyond the sky;</p>
                  <p>Such singing you will hear, never</p>
                  <p>heard by mortal ear,</p>
                  <p>‘Twill be glorious, I do declare!</p>
                  <p>And God’s own Son will be the</p>
                  <p>leading one</p>
                  <p>At the meeting in the air.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                 <p>Many things will there be missing, in</p>
                 <p>that meeting; For the mourners bench</p>
                 <p>will have no place at all; There will</p>
                 <p>never be a sermon preached to sinners,</p>
                 <p>For the sinner had refused to heed the</p>
                 <p>call. There will be no mourning over</p>
                 <p>wayward loved ones, There will be no</p>
                 <p>lonely nights of pleading prayer; All</p>
                 <p>our burdens and our anguish will be</p>
                 <p>lifted At the meeting in the air.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>There the doubters will be missing</p>
                <p>altogether, All the skeptics will be</p>
                <p>absent on that day; There will be no</p>
                <p>grumblers present to disturb us, And</p>
                <p>the Achans will be busy far away.</p>
                <p>There the saints will have His “seal</p>
                <p>upon their foreheads,” Dressed in</p>
                <p>raiment none but ransomed ones can</p>
                <p>wear; All who have the wedding</p>
                <p>garments will be present At the</p>
                <p>meeting in the air.</p>
