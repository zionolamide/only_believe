            <h3>95. It's Dripping With Blood.</h3>            
               <p>The first one to die for this Holy</p>
               <p>Ghost plan, Was John the Baptist, but</p>
               <p>he died like a man; Then cam the Lord</p>
               <p>Jesus, they crucified Him, He taught</p>
               <p>that the Spirit would save men from</p>
               <p>sin.</p>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <h3 class="chorus">Chorus</h3>
                    <p>It’s dripping with blood, yes, it’s</p>
                    <p>dripping with blood.</p>
                    <p>This Holy Ghost Gospel is</p>
                    <p>dripping with blood.</p>
                    <p>The blood of disciples who died</p>
                    <p>for the Truth,</p>
                    <p>This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping</p>
                    <p>with blood.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                 <p>There was Peter and Paul, and John</p>
                 <p>the divine, They gave up their lives so</p>
                 <p>this Gospel could shine; They mingled</p>
                 <p>their blood, like the prophets of old,</p>
                 <p>So the true Word of God could honest</p>
                 <p>be told.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>Then they stoned Stephen, he</p>
                <p>preached against sin, He made them</p>
                <p>so angry, they dashed his head in; But</p>
                <p>he died in the Spirit, and gave up the</p>
                <p>ghost, And went to join others, in that</p>
                <p>life-giving host.</p>

            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                 <p>There’s souls under the altar, crying,</p>
                 <p>“How Long?” For the Lord to punish</p>
                 <p>those who’ve done wrong; But there’s</p>
                 <p>going to be more who’ll give their life’s</p>
                 <p>blood For this Holy Ghost Gospel</p>
                 <p>and its crimson flood.</p>
