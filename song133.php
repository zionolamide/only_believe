            <h3>133. When He Reached Down .</h3>
               <p>Once my soul was astray from the</p>
               <p>heavenly way, And was wretched and</p>
               <p>vile as could be; But my Saviour</p>
               <p>above, gave me peace, joy and love,</p>
               <p>When He reached down His hand for</p>
               <p>me, for me.</p>
            <div  style="margin-top:33px;">
                <h3 class="chorus">Chorus</h3>
                    <p>When He reached down His hand</p>
                    <p>for me,</p>
                    <p>When He reached down His hand</p>
                    <p>for me;</p>
                    <p>I was lost and undone, without</p>
                    <p>God or His Son,</p>
                    <p>When He reached down His hand</p>
                    <p>for me, for me.</p>
            </div>
            <div  style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>I was nearing despair, when He came</p>
                <p>to me there, And He showed me that</p>
                <p>I could be free; Then He lifted my</p>
                <p>feet, gave me glory complete, When</p>
                <p>He reached down His hand for me, for</p>
                <p>me.</p>

            </div>
            <div  style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>How my heart doth rejoice since I</p>
                <p>made Him my choice, From the</p>
                <p>tempest to Him now I flee; Now I</p>
                <p>lean on His arm Iâ€™m secure from all</p>
                <p>harm, Since he reached down His</p>
                <p>hand for me, for me.</p>
            </div>
            <div  style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>Since the Lord gave me peace,</p>
                <p>heavenly joys never cease; Lord, I give</p>
                <p>all my life unto Thee; Guide my feet,</p>
                <p>hold my hand, grant with Thee I may</p>
                <p>stand, For you reached down your</p>
                <p>hand for me, for me.</p>
