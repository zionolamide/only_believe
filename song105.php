            <h3>105. That Man From Galilee.</h3>            
                <p>In a manger long ago, I know it’s really</p>
                <p>so, A baby was born to save men from</p>
                <p>their sin. John saw Him on the shore,</p>
                <p>the Lamb forevermore, Oh, Christ,</p>
                <p>the Crucified of Calvary.</p>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
              <h3 class="chorus">Chorus</h3>
                <p>Oh, I love the Man from Galilee,</p>
                <p>from Galilee,</p>
                <p>For He’s done so very much for</p>
                <p>me.</p>
                <p>He’s forgiven me all my sins, placed</p>
                <p>the Holy Ghost within;</p>
                <p>Oh, I love that Man from</p>
                <p>Galilee.</p>

                <p>The publican went to pray in the</p>
                <p>temple there one day, He cried, “O</p>
                <p>Lord, be merciful to me!” He was</p>
                <p>forgiven of every sin, and a deep peace</p>
                <p>placed within; He said, “Come see this</p>
                <p>Man from Galilee.”</p>

                <p>The lame was made to walk, the dumb</p>
                <p>was made to talk, That power was</p>
                <p>spoken with love upon the sea; The</p>
                <p>blind was made to see, I know it could</p>
                <p>only be The mercy of that Man from</p>
                <p>galilee.</p>

                <p>Nicodemus came by night, to know</p>
                <p>the way of right, He asked the Son of</p>
                <p>man what must he do. These words</p>
                <p>He said to him, “Ye must be born</p>
                <p>again,” By the Spirit of that Man from</p>
