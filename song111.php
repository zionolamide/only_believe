            <h3>111. What Then?.</h3>            
                <p>When the great plants of our cities</p>
                <p>have turned out their last finished</p>
                <p>work, When our merchants have sold</p>
                <p>their last yard of goods and dismissed</p>
                <p>the last tired clerk, When our banks</p>
                <p>have raked in their last dollar and paid</p>
                <p>the last dividends, When the Judge of</p>
                <p>the earth say, “closed for the night,”</p>
                <p>and asks for a balance – What Then?</p>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <h3 class="chorus">Chorus</h3>
                   <p>What then? What then?</p>
                   <p>When the great Book is opened,</p>
                   <p>what then?</p>
                   <p>When the ones that’s rejecting</p>
                   <p>this Message tonight,</p>
                   <p>Will be asked to give a reason –</p>
                   <p>What Then?</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>When the choir has sung its last song</p>
                <p>and the preacher has said his last</p>
                <p>prayer, When the people have heard</p>
                <p>their last sermon and the sound has</p>
                <p>died out in the air, When the Bible lies</p>
                <p>closed on the altar and the pews are all</p>
                <p>empty of folks, And each one stands</p>
                <p>facing his record and the great Book is</p>
                <p>opened – What Then?</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>When the actors have played their last</p>
                <p>drama and the mimic has made his last</p>
                <p>fun, When the film has flashed its last</p>
                <p>film and the billboard displayed its last</p>
                <p>run, When the crowds seeking</p>
                <p>pleasure have vanished and all the</p>
                <p>liquor stores and beer joints have been</p>
                <p>closed, And the salesman sold his last</p>
                <p>drink and gone out in the darkness,</p>
                <p>When the trumpet of ages is sounded</p>
                <p>and we stand before Him – What</p>
                <p>Then?</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>When the bugle call sinks into silence</p>
                <p>and the long marching columns stand</p>
                <p>still, And the captain repeats his last</p>
                <p>orders, And the flag has been hauled</p>
                <p>from the mast. And the wounded</p>
                <p>afield checked in and a world that</p>
                <p>rejects its Saviour is asked for a reason</p>
                <p>– What Then?</p>
