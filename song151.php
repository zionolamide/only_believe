                <p>There are people almost everywhere,</p>
                <p>Whose hearts are all aflame With the</p>
                <p>fire that fell at Pentecost, Which</p>
                <p>cleansed and made them clean; It is</p>
                <p>burning now within my heart, All</p>
                <p>glory to His name! I’m so glad that I</p>
