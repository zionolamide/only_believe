            <h3>62. Yesterday, Today, Forever.</h3>            
                <p>Oh, how sweet the glorious message,</p>
                <p>Simple faith may claim; Yesterday,</p>
                <p>today, forever, Jesus is the same. Still</p>
                <p>He loves to save the sinful, Heal the</p>
                <p>sick and lame; Cheer the mourner, still</p>
                <p>the tempest; Glory to His name!</p>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <h3 class="chorus">Chorus</h3>
                   <p>Yesterday, today, forever,</p>
                   <p>Jesus is the same;</p>
                   <p>All may change, but Jesus never!</p>
                   <p>Glory to His name.</p>
                   <p>Glory to His name,</p>
                   <p>Glory to His name;</p>
                   <p>All may change, but Jesus never!</p>
                   <p>Glory to His name.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>He who was the friend of sinners,</p>
                <p>Seeks thee, lost one, now; Sinner,</p>
                <p>come, and at His footstool Penitently</p>
                <p>bow. He who said, “I’ll not condemn</p>
                <p>thee, Go and sin no more;” Speaks to</p>
                <p>thee that word of pardon, As in days</p>
                <p>of yore.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                 <p>Oft on earth He healed the suff’rer By</p>
                 <p>His mighty hand; Still our sicknesses</p>
                 <p>and sorrows Go at His command. He</p>
                 <p>who gave His healing virtue, To a</p>
                 <p>woman’s touch; To the faith that</p>
                 <p>claims His fullness, Still will give as</p>
                 <p>much.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>He who pardoned erring Peter, Never</p>
                <p>need’st thou fear; He that came to</p>
                <p>faithless Thomas, All thy doubt will</p>
                <p>clear. He who let the loved disciple</p>
                <p>On His bosom rest, Bids thee still,</p>
                <p>with love as tender, Lean upon His</p>
                <p>breast.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>He who ‘mid the raging billows,</p>
                <p>Walked upon the sea; Still can hush</p>
                <p>our wildest tempest, As on Galilee.</p>
                <p>He who wept and prayed in anguish,</p>
                <p>In Gethsemane, Drinks with us each</p>
                <p>cup of trembling, In our agony.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                 <p>As of old He walked to Emmaus,</p>
                 <p>With them to abide; So through all</p>
                 <p>life’s way He walketh, Ever near our</p>
                 <p>side. Soon again we shall behold Him,</p>
                 <p>Hasten, Lord, the day! But ‘twill still be</p>
                 <p>“this same Jesus,” As He went away.</p>
