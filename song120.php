            <h3>120. Room At The Fountain.</h3>
               <p>I heard my loving Savior say, There’s</p>
               <p>room at the fountain for thee, Come,</p>
               <p>wash the stains of sin away, There’s</p>
               <p>room at the fountain for thee.</p>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
               <h3 class="chorus">Chorus</h3>
                  <p>Room, room yes, there is room,</p>
                  <p>Room at the fountain for thee;</p>
                  <p>Room, room, yes, there is room,</p>
                  <p>There’s room at the fountain for</p>

            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                  <p>I came to Him, my sins confessed,</p>
                  <p>There was room at the fountain for</p>
                  <p>me; When I gave up, my heart was</p>
                  <p>blest, There’s room at the fountain for</p>
                  <p>thee.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>I plunged beneath the crimson tide,</p>
                <p>There was room at the fountain for</p>
                <p>me; And now by faith am sanctified,</p>
                <p>There’s room at the fountain for thee.</p>

                <p>I found the crimson stream I know,</p>
                <p>There was room at the fountain for</p>
                <p>me; His blood has washed me white as</p>
                <p>snow, There’s room at the fountain</p>
                <p>for thee.</p>

               <p>breath, There was room at the</p>
               <p>fountain for me; He saved me from an</p>
               <p>awful death. There’s room at the</p>
