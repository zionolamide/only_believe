            <h3>85. When I Get To The End.</h3>            
                <p>The sands have been washed in the</p>
                <p>footprints Of the Stranger on Galilee’s</p>
                <p>shore, And the voice that subdued the</p>
                <p>rough billows, Will be heard in Judea</p>
                <p>no more. But the path of that lone</p>
                <p>Galilean With joy I will follow today,</p>
                <p>And the toils of the road will seem</p>
                <p>nothing, When I get to the end of the</p>
                <p>way, And the toils of the road will</p>
                <p>seem nothing, When I get to the end</p>
                <p>of the way.</p>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>There are so many hills to climb</p>
                <p>upward, I often am longing for rest,</p>
                <p>But He who appoints me my pathway,</p>
                <p>Knows just what is needful and best, I</p>
                <p>know in His word He hath promised</p>
                <p>That my strength, “it shall be as my</p>
                <p>day.” And the toils of the road will</p>
                <p>seem nothing, When I get to the end</p>
                <p>of the way, And the toils of the road</p>
                <p>will seem nothing, When I get to the</p>
                <p>end of the way.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                 <p>He loves me too well to forsake me</p>
                 <p>Or give me one trial too much, All His</p>
                 <p>people have been dearly purchased,</p>
                 <p>And Satan can never claim such. By</p>
                 <p>and by I shall see Him and praise Him,</p>
                 <p>In the city of unending day. And the</p>
                 <p>toils of the road will seem nothing,</p>
                 <p>When I get to the end of the way, And</p>
                 <p>the toils of the road will seem nothing,</p>
                 <p>When I get to the end of the way.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top:33px;">
                <p>When the last feeble step has been</p>
                <p>taken, And the gates of that city</p>
                <p>appear, And the beautiful songs of the</p>
                <p>angels Float out on my listening ear.</p>
                <p>When all that now seems so mysterious</p>
                <p>Will be bright and as clear as the day.</p>
                <p>Then the toils of the road will seem</p>
                <p>nothing. When I get to the end of the</p>
                <p>way, Then the toils of the road will</p>
                <p>seem nothing, When I get to the end</p>
                <p>of the way.</p>
